# United-States-Air-Quality-And-Temp
Introduction to Data Science Final Project

The project goal is to analyze the Air Quality in the United States over the past three decades. In addition to analyzing the air quality of the past, models were constructed to predict the future air quality. To do this, the entire data set was separated into two sections: training and testing. The training data was used to create models, namely a basic linear regression model and the Holt-Winters' Model. The testing data was used to measure how each model holds and in combination with the mean-sqaured-error, that measure was quantified. A similar analysis was done with data dealing with the United States Temperature over the past three decades.
